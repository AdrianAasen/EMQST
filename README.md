# Error mitigated quantum state tomographty (EMQST)
This is the code base used to perform readout error mitigation for the project assosiated to this [publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04211)

A tutorial notebook of how to run EMQST is provided with examples of how to create your own simulations and also loading in data from previous runs.
