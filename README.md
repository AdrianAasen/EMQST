# Readout error mitigated quantum state tomographty (REMQST)
This is the code base used to perform readout error mitigation for the project assosiated to the publication: [Here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-024-01790-8).

A tutorial notebook of how to run EMQST is provided with examples of how to create your own simulations and also loading in data from previous runs.
